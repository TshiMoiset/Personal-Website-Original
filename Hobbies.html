        <h1>Games</h1>
        <p>
          I like many games, especially action games. My favorite games right
          now are GTA 5, For Honor and The last of us 2. I look forward to
          playing a game called Cyperpunk 2077. It looks really good. I do not
          know if I can say that it is my favorite game because I have not
          played it yet but it is similar to the Spider man Ps4 game. The game
          is called Spider Man Miles Morales.

        <h1>Series</h1>
        <p>
          I'm not a series person but I watch series sometimes. I used to watch
          a series called The flash but it has gotten bad. Now I watch a series
          called Prison Break and it is very good. The series is abaout a guy
          named Lincoln Burrows, who was sentenced to death for a murder he did
          not commit. You understand what will happen later. It's called Prison
          Break haha. Another series I like is "YOU". Yes haha, the series is
          called that. But it is very good.

        <h1>Movies</h1>
        <p>
          I like watching movies, especially action. If you like action, we
          should become friends haha. I like a lots of movies. Examples of some
          are John Wick, Rampage - Big Meets Bigger and Skyscraper. But my
          absolute favorite movies comes from Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).
          I'm a big fan of Marvel. If you're wondering, I just want to say that
          Iron Man is my favorite.

        <p>
          Music is NICE. I listen to music very often. On the bus, on the train
          and when I study, for example. My favorite genre is pop & hip hop.
          It's nice. Right now I am listen a lot to the rapper Roddy Ricch. I
          also listen to other artists such as Avicii, Dree Low(Swedish artist)
          and Nico & Vinz.
